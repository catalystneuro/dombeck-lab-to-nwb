  experiment_description: |
    Dopamine neurons are characterized by their response to unexpected rewards, but they also fire during movement and
    aversive stimuli. Dopamine neuron diversity has been observed based on molecular expression profiles; however,
    whether different functions map onto such genetic subtypes remains unclear. In this study, we established that
    three genetic dopamine neuron subtypes within the substantia nigra pars compacta, characterized by the expression
    of Slc17a6 (Vglut2), Calb1 and Anxa1, each have a unique set of responses to rewards, aversive stimuli and
    accelerations and decelerations, and these signaling patterns are highly correlated between somas and axons within
    subtypes. Remarkably, reward responses were almost entirely absent in the Anxa1+ subtype, which instead displayed
    acceleration-correlated signaling. Our findings establish a connection between functional and genetic dopamine
    neuron subtypes and demonstrate that molecular expression patterns can serve as a common framework to dissect
    dopaminergic functions.
  session_description: |
    This session contains fiber photometry recordings from head-fixed mice running on a treadmill while receiving
    rewards and aversive air puffs in order to analyze differences or similarities in functional responses of different
    subtypes of striatonigral dopamine neurons.

    Adult mice (postnatal 2–4 months old) were anesthetized with isoflurane (1–2%), and a 0.5–1-mm-diameter craniotomy
    was made over the right substantia nigra (−3.25 mm caudal, +1.55 mm lateral from bregma).
    A small volume (0.4 μl total) of virus (AAV8-EF1α-CreOn/FlpOn-GCaMP6f (RRID:Addgene_137122, titer 6.10 × 1013)
    for Aldh1a1-iCre/Th-Flpo, Vglut2-IRES-Cre/Th-Flpo and Calb1-IRES2-Cre/Th-Flpo mice or AAV1-CAG-FLEX-GCaMP6f
    (RRID:Addgene_100835, titer 2.00 × 1013) for DAT-Cre or Anxa1-iCre mice), diluted 1:1 in PBS, was pressure injected
    through a pulled glass micropipette into the SNc at four depths (−3.8, −4.1, −4.4 and −4.7 mm ventral from dura
    surface, 0.1 μl per depth). After the injections, the skull and craniotomy were sealed with Metabond (Parkell),
    and a custom metal headplate was installed for head fixation. The location of recording sites was marked on the
    surface of the Metabond for future access. For Calb1-IRES2-Cre/DAT-tTA/Ai93D mice, which express GCaMP6f
    endogenously, no injection was conducted, and only the headplate was implanted at this time. Four weeks were
    allowed for GCaMP6f expression to ramp up and fill dopaminergic somas in SNc and axons in striatum.
