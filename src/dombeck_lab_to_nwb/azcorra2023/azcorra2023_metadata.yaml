    Dopamine neurons are characterized by their response to unexpected rewards, but they also fire during movement and
    aversive stimuli. Dopamine neuron diversity has been observed based on molecular expression profiles; however,
    whether different functions map onto such genetic subtypes remains unclear. In this study, we established that
    three genetic dopamine neuron subtypes within the substantia nigra pars compacta, characterized by the expression
    of Slc17a6 (Vglut2), Calb1 and Anxa1, each have a unique set of responses to rewards, aversive stimuli and
    accelerations and decelerations, and these signaling patterns are highly correlated between somas and axons within
    subtypes. Remarkably, reward responses were almost entirely absent in the Anxa1+ subtype, which instead displayed
    acceleration-correlated signaling. Our findings establish a connection between functional and genetic dopamine
    neuron subtypes and demonstrate that molecular expression patterns can serve as a common framework to dissect
    dopaminergic functions.
