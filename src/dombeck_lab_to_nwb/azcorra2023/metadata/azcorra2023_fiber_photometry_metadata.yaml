        description: |
         Blue excitation light (470 nm LED, Thorlabs, M70F3) and violet excitation light (for the isosbestic control)
         were coupled into the optic fiber such that a power of 0.75 mW was delivered to the fiber tip.
         Then, 470 nm and 405 nm excitation were alternated at 100 Hz using a waveform generator,
         each filtered with a corresponding filter.
