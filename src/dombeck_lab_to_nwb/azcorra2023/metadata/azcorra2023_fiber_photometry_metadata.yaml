  Fibers:
    description: |
      One or two optical fibers (200-μm diameter, 0.57 NA, Doric MFP_200/230/900-0.57_1.5m_FC-FLT_LAF) were lowered
      slowly (5 μm s−1) using a micromanipulator (Sutter Instrument, MP285) into the brain to various depths measured
      from the dura surface. In the striatum, recording depths ranged from 1.6 mm to 4.1 mm; in SNc, depths ranged
      from 3.5 mm to 4.5 mm. Recordings started at 1.6 mm in striatum and 3.5 mm in SNc, but if no ΔF/F transients were
      detected at those depths, the fiber was moved down in increments of 0.25–0.5 mm in striatum or 0.15–0.2 mm in SNc,
      until transients were detected. From there, a 15 minutes recording was obtained, and the fiber was moved further down
      in the same increments. Subsequent recordings were obtained until a depth was reached where transients were no
      longer detected, at which point the fiber was pulled out of the brain slowly (5 μm s−1).

  ExcitationSources:
    description: |
      Blue excitation light (470 nm LED, Thorlabs, M70F3) and purple excitation light (for the isosbestic control)
      (405 nm LED, Thorlabs, M405FP1) were coupled into the optic fiber such that a power of 0.75 mW emanated from the
      fiber tip. Then, 470 nm and 405 nm excitation were alternated at 100 Hz using a waveform generator,
      each filtered with a corresponding filter (Semrock, FF01-406/15-25 and Semrock, FF02-472/30-25)
      and combined with a dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology, T425lpxr).

      Green fluorescence was separated from the excitation light by a dichroic mirror (Chroma Technology, T505lpxr)
      and further filtered (Semrock, FF01-540/50-25) before collection using a GaAsP PMT
      (H10770PA-40, Hamamatsu; signal amplified using Stanford Research Systems SR570 preamplifier).
